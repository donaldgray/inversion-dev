## `Inversion.Web.Harness.Site`, project notes

This site is backed by `Inversion.Web.Harness`.

This is just a scratch web set for tooling around druing development.
It's not destined to be a part of any public release.

It may be informative to see how a "hello world" application might
be wired up, but `Conclave` serves as a better example for how an
application should be wired.
